  -V, --version
          Print version information

By default, Comrak will attempt to read command-line options from a config file specified by
--config-file. This behaviour can be disabled by passing --config-file none. It is not an error if
the file does not exist.
```

And there's a Rust interface. You can use `comrak::markdown_to_html` directly:

``` rust
use comrak::{markdown_to_html, Options};
assert_eq!(markdown_to_html("Hello, **世界**!", &Options::default()),
           "<p>Hello, <strong>世界</strong>!</p>\n");
```

Or you can parse the input into an AST yourself, manipulate it, and then use your desired formatter:

``` rust
extern crate comrak;
use comrak::nodes::NodeValue;
use comrak::{format_html, parse_document, Arena, Options};

fn replace_text(document: &str, orig_string: &str, replacement: &str) -> String {
    // The returned nodes are created in the supplied Arena, and are bound by its lifetime.
    let arena = Arena::new();

    // Parse the document into a root `AstNode`
    let root = parse_document(&arena, document, &Options::default());

    // Iterate over all the descendants of root.
    for node in root.descendants() {
        if let NodeValue::Text(ref mut text) = node.data.borrow_mut().value {
            // If the node is a text node, perform the string replacement.
            *text = text.replace(orig_string, replacement)
        }
    }

    let mut html = vec![];
    format_html(root, &Options::default(), &mut html).unwrap();

    String::from_utf8(html).unwrap()
}

fn main() {
    let doc = "This is my input.\n\n1. Also [my](#) input.\n2. Certainly *my* input.\n";
    let orig = "my";
    let repl = "your";
    let html = replace_text(&doc, &orig, &repl);

    println!("{}", html);
}
```

## Benchmarking

For running benchmarks, you will need to [install hyperfine](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine#installation) and optionally cmake.

If you want to just run the benchmark for `comrak`, with the current state of the repo, you can simply run

``` bash
make bench-comrak
```

This will build comrak in release mode, and run benchmark on it. You will see the time measurements as reported by hyperfine in the console.

Makefile also provides a way to run benchmarks for `comrak` current state (with your changes), `comrak` main branch, [`cmark-gfm`](https://github.com/github/cmark-gfm), [`pulldown-cmark`](https://github.com/raphlinus/pulldown-cmark) and [`markdown-it.rs`](https://github.com/rlidwka/markdown-it.rs). For this you will need to install `cmake`. After that make sure that you have set-up the git submodules. In case you have not installed submodules when cloning, you can do it by running

``` bash
git submodule update --init
```

After this is done, you can run

``` bash
make bench-all
```

which will run benchmarks across all, and report the time take by each as well as relative time.

Apart from this, CI is also setup for running benchmarks when a pull request is first opened. It will add a comment with the results on the pull request in a tabular format comparing the 5 versions. After that you can manually trigger this CI by commenting `/run-bench` on the PR, this will update the existing comment with new results. Note benchmarks won't be automatically run on each push.

## Security

As with [`cmark`](https://github.com/commonmark/cmark) and [`cmark-gfm`](https://github.com/github/cmark-gfm#security),
Comrak will scrub raw HTML and potentially dangerous links. This change was introduced in Comrak 0.4.0 in support of a
safe-by-default posture.

To allow these, use the `unsafe_` option (or `--unsafe` with the command line program). If doing so, we recommend the
use of a sanitisation library like [`ammonia`](https://github.com/notriddle/ammonia) configured specific to your needs.

## Extensions

Comrak supports the five extensions to CommonMark defined in the [GitHub Flavored Markdown
Spec](https://github.github.com/gfm/):

- [Tables](https://github.github.com/gfm/#tables-extension-)
- [Task list items](https://github.github.com/gfm/#task-list-items-extension-)
- [Strikethrough](https://github.github.com/gfm/#strikethrough-extension-)
- [Autolinks](https://github.github.com/gfm/#autolinks-extension-)
- [Disallowed Raw HTML](https://github.github.com/gfm/#disallowed-raw-html-extension-)

Comrak additionally supports its own extensions, which are yet to be specced out (PRs welcome\!):

- Superscript
- Header IDs
- Footnotes
- Description lists
- Front matter
- Shortcodes
- Math
- Multiline Blockquotes

By default none are enabled; they are individually enabled with each parse by setting the appropriate values in the
[`ComrakExtensionOptions` struct](https://docs.rs/comrak/newest/comrak/type.ComrakExtensionOptions.html).

## Plugins

### Codefence syntax highlighter

At the moment syntax highlighting of codefence blocks is the only feature that can be enhanced with plugins.

Create an implementation of the `SyntaxHighlighterAdapter` trait, and then provide an instance of such adapter to
`Plugins.render.codefence_syntax_highlighter`. For formatting a markdown document with plugins, use the
`markdown_to_html_with_plugins` function, which accepts your plugin as a parameter.

See the `syntax_highlighter.rs` and `syntect.rs` examples for more details.

#### Syntect

[`syntect`](https://github.com/trishume/syntect) is a syntax highlighting library for Rust. By default, `comrak` offers
a plugin for it. In order to utilize it, create an instance of `plugins::syntect::SyntectAdapter` and use it as your
`Plugins` option.

## Related projects

Comrak's design goal is to model the upstream [`cmark-gfm`](https://github.com/github/cmark-gfm) as closely as possible
in terms of code structure. The upside of this is that a change in `cmark-gfm` has a very predictable change in Comrak.
Likewise, any bug in `cmark-gfm` is likely to be reproduced in Comrak. This could be considered a pro or a con,
depending on your use case.

The downside, of course, is that the code is not what I'd call idiomatic Rust (*so many `RefCell`s*), and while
contributors and I have made it as fast as possible, it simply won't be as fast as some other CommonMark parsers
depending on your use-case. Here are some other projects to consider:

- [Raph Levien](https://github.com/raphlinus)'s [`pulldown-cmark`](https://github.com/google/pulldown-cmark). It's
  very fast, uses a novel parsing algorithm, and doesn't construct an AST (but you can use it to make one if you
  want). `cargo doc` uses this, as do many other projects in the ecosystem.
- [markdown-rs](https://github.com/wooorm/markdown-rs) (1.x) looks worth watching.
- Know of another library? Please open a PR to add it\!

As far as I know, Comrak is the only library to implement all of the [GitHub Flavored Markdown
extensions](https://github.github.com/gfm) to the spec, but this tends to only be important if you want to reproduce
GitHub's Markdown rendering exactly, e.g. in a GitHub client app.
