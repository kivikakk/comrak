# Code of Conduct

We are sentient.  
To be sentient is to be limited.  
In our limitation, we make choices that are unwise or are flawed.

If we make unwise choices because of our limitation,  
we cannot judge others for the same reason.

So, we cannot judge,  
thus we forgive. 

This project and its results are intended as:  
a place of learning,  
a place of understanding,  
a place of teaching,  
a place of sharing,  
a place of creators creating the tools for other creators to create complicated things elegantly.

Be well, Creator. Be well and create.
