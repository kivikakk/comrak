The WASM target lets it be used [directly in webpages].

This webpage is [created with Comrak] by stitching together three elements:

* [`header.html`]
* [`index.md`] converted with `--header-ids "" --smart -e footnotes`
* [`footer.html`]

The CLI help for the latest version is available in the [README], and the Rust documentation is on [docs.rs].
