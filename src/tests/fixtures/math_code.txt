# TeX Math

Inline math goes between `` $` `` characters, and display math
use the code block ``` ```math ````:

```````````````````````````````` example
Let $`x`$ and $`y`$ be integers such that

```math
x=y + 2
```
.
<p>Let <code data-math-style="inline">x</code> and <code data-math-style="inline">y</code> be integers such that</p>
<pre><code class="language-math" data-math-style="display">x=y + 2
</code></pre>
````````````````````````````````


In inline math, it behaves just like inline code.

```````````````````````````````` example
This is math:$`2000`$.
.
<p>This is math:<code data-math-style="inline">2000</code>.</p>
````````````````````````````````


Note that math can contain embedded math.  In scanning
for a closing delimiter, we do not need to skip material in balanced
curly braces:

```````````````````````````````` example
This is display math:

```math
\text{Hello $x^2$}
```
And this is inline math:
$`\text{Hello $x$ there!}`$
.
<p>This is display math:</p>
<pre><code class="language-math" data-math-style="display">\text{Hello $x^2$}
</code></pre>
<p>And this is inline math:
<code data-math-style="inline">\text{Hello $x$ there!}</code></p>
````````````````````````````````


Dollar signs not required to be backslashed. It may be
required to render the math properly, but it's not required
for parsing:

```````````````````````````````` example
$`\text{$}`$
.
<p><code data-math-style="inline">\text{$}</code></p>
````````````````````````````````

Everything inside the math construction is treated
as math, and not given its normal commonmark meaning.

```````````````````````````````` example
$`b<a>c`$
.
<p><code data-math-style="inline">b&lt;a&gt;c</code></p>
````````````````````````````````

Double dollar signs are not supported

```````````````````````````````` example
$$`1 + 2`$$
.
<p>$$<code>1 + 2</code>$$</p>
````````````````````````````````
