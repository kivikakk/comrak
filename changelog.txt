# [v0.25.0] - 2024-07-12

* Discord-flavored Markdown by @Meow and @liamwhite in https://github.com/kivikakk/comrak/pull/421
  * Three new extensions and two render options are added:
    * `extension.underline` adds support for `__underlined__` text.
    * `extension.spoiler` adds support for `||spoiler||` text.
    * `extension.greentext` adds support for image board-style `>greentext`,
      which isn't transformed into a blockquote.
    * `render.ignore_setext` disables parsing setext-style headings.
    * `render.ignore_empty_links` causes links with no text (like `[](xyz)`) to
      remain in the text as-is.
* nodes: add From impls for AstNode. by @kivikakk in https://github.com/kivikakk/comrak/pull/424
  * Back by popular demand: `AstNode::from(NodeValue)`.
  * Also added is `AstNode::from(Ast)`, if you have sourcepos.
* AST validation by @yannham in https://github.com/kivikakk/comrak/pull/425
  * The AST is validated when formatting a document as CommonMark in debug builds.
* Address autolink edge cases. by @kivikakk in https://github.com/kivikakk/comrak/pull/426
  * Autolinks had many edge cases where output differed from upstream
    `cmark-gfm`. These have been fixed by following upstream's parser design
    closely.
* shortcodes: capture all known aliases. by @kivikakk in https://github.com/kivikakk/comrak/pull/427
  * We didn't parse shortcodes containing numbers or `+`. We do now.
* Support both upstream CommonMark and GFM's differences in the base spec. by @kivikakk in https://github.com/kivikakk/comrak/pull/428
  * GFM modifies even base CommonMark output somewhat. We now support and
    validate against both.
* cm: count ol items from start of each list. by @kivikakk in https://github.com/kivikakk/comrak/pull/429
  * Ordered list item numbers are normalised on formatting back to CommonMark.
* arena_tree: panic if iterator invalidation causes trouble. by @kivikakk in https://github.com/kivikakk/comrak/pull/437
  * `arena_tree` would silently stop iteration when trying to proceed from a
    child that had lost its parent. It now panics instead, as the old behaviour
    is incorrect and impossible to notice.
* broken reflink callback updates & big cleanup. by @kivikakk in https://github.com/kivikakk/comrak/pull/438
  * The broken reference link callback has been moved into `ParseOptions` (which
    now takes a lifetime, meaning `Options` does too).
  * The callback now takes a struct containing both the normalised reference,
    and the original text, and the return value has changed from a 2-tuple to a
    struct for clarity.
  * `parse_document_with_broken_link_callback` has been marked deprecated.
* Inline sourcepos fixes. by @kivikakk in https://github.com/kivikakk/comrak/pull/439
  * Inline sourcepos was provided on a best-effort basis, but there are multiple
    correctness issues which can't be fixed without significant work.
  * Inline sourcepos is no longer reported in HTML output. It remains in the AST
    and in XML output, but it is not reliable. See the PR for details.
  * Link sourcepos is slightly better than it was when it spans multiple lines.
