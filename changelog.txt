20% faster.

* SECURITY: GHSA-8hqf-xjwp-p67v / Quadratic runtime when parsing Markdown (GHSL-2023-047)
  * <https://github.com/kivikakk/comrak/security/advisories/GHSA-8hqf-xjwp-p67v>
  * A variety of quadratic runtime issues that could lead to DoS were reported
    and addressed.

  * <https://github.com/kivikakk/comrak/security/advisories/GHSA-5r3x-p7xx-x6q5>
  * AST nodes no longer store raw `Vec<u8>`s, and instead store `String`s.
* Various API points were cleaned up.
* Comrak now targets Rust 2018.

Many thanks to @philipturnbull and @darakian of the GitHub Security Lab for
bringing these issues to my attention and detailing the reproduction steps for
