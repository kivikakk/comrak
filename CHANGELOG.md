# [v0.46.1] - 2025-10-30

Martin Chrástek has fixed _all known sourcepos issues_ in Comrak, while closing a number of other bugs at the same time! I'm so happy.

New APIs:

* `NodeCodeBlock` now has a `closed` property. (by @Martin005 in https://github.com/kivikakk/comrak/pull/661)
* `NodeHeading` now has a `closed` property, for closed ATX-style headings. (by @Martin005 in https://github.com/kivikakk/comrak/pull/665)

Bug fixes:

* Source position information for lists and their children is fixed. (by @Martin005 in https://github.com/kivikakk/comrak/pull/666)
* Source position information for unclosed fenced code blocks is fixed. (by @Martin005 in https://github.com/kivikakk/comrak/pull/661)
* `Escaped` and `EscapedTag` no longer fail AST validation when formatting as CommonMark with debug assertions. (by @kivikakk in https://github.com/kivikakk/comrak/pull/662, https://github.com/kivikakk/comrak/pull/664)

Build changes:

* The fuzzer now also runs on CommonMark and XML output formats. (by @kivikakk in https://github.com/kivikakk/comrak/pull/663)

# [v0.46.0] - 2025-10-28

Please note the MSRV has been bumped from 1.65 to 1.70; see [the pull request](https://github.com/kivikakk/comrak/pull/649) for more details. It's a kind of sticky and awkward situation — thanks to the inevitability of Progress — with no particularly clean solution. (wherein telling GCC 15 users "sorry it just won't build from source for you without messing with dependencies" is not a solution.)

Security:

* Footnote resolution no longer recurses over the document tree; on documents with deeply nested elements, this could cause a stack overflow, with resultant denial of service. (by @kivikakk in https://github.com/kivikakk/comrak/pull/659)
* Inline footnotes are restricted to a depth of 5 for similar reasons. An iterative rewrite here to avoid a limit is possible, but for now I'm hoping we can all pretend to be responsible adult human beings and limit our recursive inline footnote usage accordingly. (PRs welcome tho, non-human users are very welcome!) (by @kivikakk in https://github.com/kivikakk/comrak/pull/659)

Parser changes:

* U+2069 POP DIRECTIONAL ISOLATE will be treated as terminating an autolink, rather than included as part of the link, making autolinks much easier to use correctly in RTL text. (by @SethFalco in https://github.com/kivikakk/comrak/pull/654)
* HTML start condition 4 is correctly detected when non-capital letters follow "<!". (by @kivikakk in https://github.com/kivikakk/comrak/pull/658)

New APIs:

* Discord-style subtext support is added as the `subtext` extension. (by @Kuuuube in https://github.com/kivikakk/comrak/pull/648, https://github.com/kivikakk/comrak/pull/650)

Bug fixes:

* Source position information is corrected for description lists, HTML blocks, multiline block quotes, links with newlines following the destination, tables with leading indentation, and escaped character spans. (by @Martin005 in https://github.com/kivikakk/comrak/pull/646, https://github.com/kivikakk/comrak/pull/651, https://github.com/kivikakk/comrak/pull/652, https://github.com/kivikakk/comrak/pull/653, https://github.com/kivikakk/comrak/pull/656, https://github.com/kivikakk/comrak/pull/657)
* `escaped_char_span` users can now successfully format to CommonMark with debug assertions enabled. These ASTs previously did not validate, which currently is enabled experimentally only in CommonMark output in debug. (by @kivikakk in https://github.com/kivikakk/comrak/pull/659)

Build changes:

* Comrak's MSRV is bumped from 1.65 to 1.70. (by @kivikakk in https://github.com/kivikakk/comrak/pull/649)

# [v0.45.0] - 2025-10-23

Welcome to v0.45.0! This is a big update, much of them part of from [rc.1 from last week](https://github.com/kivikakk/comrak/releases/tag/v0.45.0-rc.1).  More context on the size of the update in the changelog there.

The biggest library user-facing changes are ergonomic: `Node<'a>` instead of `&'a AstNode<'a>`, is nice, and so likewise `node.data()` instead of `node.data.borrow()`.  They're small, but I appreciate them a lot in my own work.

You'll also notice more bovine creatures in the Comrak pasture: there's a few `Cow<str>` instead of `String`, such as in `NodeValue::Text`.  At most an extra `.into()` will be required; take note if you use any `'static str`, as they'll no longer need to be heap-allocated.  Some `Box`es have been added, too, to reduce the size of every `NodeValue`.  Let the types guide you.

Other than this, the options have been put in their own module (`comrak::options`), and a lot of things generally cleaned up. Read below for all the deets!  Here's the final performance comparison to v0.44.0 on aarch64:

```
Benchmark 1: ./bench.sh ./comrak-0.44.0
  Time (mean ± σ):      88.1 ms ±   1.9 ms    [User: 71.2 ms, System: 17.8 ms]
  Range (min … max):    86.2 ms …  93.2 ms    31 runs

Benchmark 2: ./bench.sh ./comrak-0.45.0
  Time (mean ± σ):      67.0 ms ±   1.2 ms    [User: 51.2 ms, System: 17.0 ms]
  Range (min … max):    65.2 ms …  70.0 ms    42 runs

Summary
  ./bench.sh ./comrak-0.45.0 ran
    1.32 ± 0.04 times faster than ./bench.sh ./comrak-0.44.0
```

Be well!

Parser changes:

* Runs of more than two `~` are no longer recognised as valid delimiters, meaning they will not prevent strikethrough recognition when they occur within correct delimiters. See the PR for discussion. (by @miketheman in https://github.com/kivikakk/comrak/pull/635)
  * This does not impact spec compatibility, matches `cmark-gfm`, and follows the intent of the original implementation and implementor (hi!).

Changed APIs:

* `r#unsafe` is used instead of `unsafe_`. (by @kivikakk in https://github.com/kivikakk/comrak/pull/640)
* `--gemojis` is renamed to `--gemoji`. (by @kivikakk in https://github.com/kivikakk/comrak/pull/641)
* `NodeValue::Text` now contains a `Cow<'static, str>` instead of a `String`. This is a pretty major change, but means we can now create text nodes with static content without duplicating the string on the heap. This particularly benefits smart quotes and HTML entity resolution. (by @kivikakk in https://github.com/kivikakk/comrak/pull/627)
  * Adapting to this change usually means nothing on the read-only side (you can use it as a `&str` without issues); to write in-place, use `.to_mut()` on the `Cow` to get a `&mut String`. To assign, use `.into()` on a `&str` or `String`, like `NodeValue::Text("moo".into())`.
  * `NodeValue::text()` now returns a `&str`. It used to return a `&String` (!).
  * `NodeValue::text_mut()` now returns a `&mut Cow<'static, str>`, instead of a `&mut String`. This permits writing a borrowed reference.
  * I am experimenting with parameterising the lifetime on the `Cow`; it'd be amazing to refer continuously to the input where possible.
* `NodeValue`'s `CodeBlock`, `Table`, `Link`, `Image`, `ShortCode` and `Alert` variants' payloads are now boxed. (by @kivikakk in https://github.com/kivikakk/comrak/pull/632)
  * Adapting to this change usually means adding a `Box::new` call when constructing these nodes, and on matches, pulling the box out and then just dereferencing it directly (e.g. `NodeValue::Table(nt) => &nt.alignments` instead of `NodeValue::Table(NodeTable { ref alignments })`.
  * These payloads were larger than average, increasing the size of every node considerably. The changes reduce an `Ast` to 128 bytes, and a full `AstNode<'_>` to 176 bytes.
  * This produces a performance sweet spot: boxing the whole `NodeValue` results in worse performance than doing nothing at all. This change appreciably improves matters.
  * We now assert the size of a node during build to ensure future payload changes don't increase the total size of an `Ast`.
* Options now live in `comrak::options`. Structs have been renamed to remove `Options` from their name: `comrak::RenderOptions` is now `comrak::options::Render`, etc. The old names are marked deprecated. (@kivikakk in https://github.com/kivikakk/comrak/pull/636)
  * Traits cannot be aliased [yet](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/41517) :( `URLRewriter` and `BrokenLinkCallback` have been moved, without a deprecation period.
* `SyntaxHighlighterAdapter`'s `attributes` arguments now take `HashMap<&'static str, Cow<'s, str>>`; they used to take `HashMap<String, String>`. (by @kivikakk in https://github.com/kivikakk/comrak/pull/633)
* `html::write_opening_tag` can now take different `AsRef<str>` types for the attribute key and value.
* `parse_document_with_broken_link_callback` has been removed!  This entrypoint has been deprecated since 0.25.0. (by @kivikakk in https://github.com/kivikakk/comrak/pull/623)
* `options.render.ignore_setext` was moved to `options.parse.ignore_setext`, as its effect takes place only in the parse stage. (by @kivikakk in https://github.com/kivikakk/comrak/pull/623)
* `nodes::can_contain_type` is now `Node::can_contain_type`. (by @kivikakk in https://github.com/kivikakk/comrak/pull/625)


New APIs:

* `node.data()` and `node.data_mut()` are added as short-hand for `node.data.borrow()` and `node.data.borrow_mut()` respectively. (by @kivikakk in https://github.com/kivikakk/comrak/pull/643)
* `comrak::nodes::Node<'a>` is introduced as an alias for `&'a comrak::nodes::AstNode<'a>`. (by @kivikakk in https://github.com/kivikakk/comrak/pull/627)
* `options.parse.tasklist_in_table` added: parse a tasklist item if it's the only content of a table cell. (by @kivikakk in https://github.com/kivikakk/comrak/pull/622)

Performance:

* Inline content is transferred to Text nodes without copying where possible. (by @kivikakk in https://github.com/kivikakk/comrak/pull/642).
* Have you looked at your 7 year old code lately? A detail in the C-to-Rust translation meant essentially every line of input was being copied completely unnecessarily at the very beginning of the line processing stage. This no longer happens. We regret the error. (by @kivikakk in https://github.com/kivikakk/comrak/pull/629)
* Preprocess entity data at build-time so we don't spend time doing a linear search over an unsorted array, some of which we will never match. (by @kivikakk in https://github.com/kivikakk/comrak/pull/631)
* Inline content is consumed by the inline processor, instead of being borrowed by it and retained in memory indefinitely. (by @kivikakk in https://github.com/kivikakk/comrak/pull/631)
* Don't try to do better than the stdlib at guessing buffer sizes; it's very good at it. (by @kivikakk in https://github.com/kivikakk/comrak/pull/626)
* Use `str` internally in block and inline processing, eliminating many UTF-8 rechecks. The `strings` module actually operates on strings now. (by @kivikakk in https://github.com/kivikakk/comrak/pull/626)
* Many, many needless clones have been removed in almost every subsystem.

Dependency updates:

* `memchr` removed from `Cargo.toml`; it wasn't used directly, though it still is included unconditionally due to `caseless`. (by @kivikakk in https://github.com/kivikakk/comrak/pull/630)
* `slug` is moved to a development-only dependency; it's only used in an example. (by @kivikakk in https://github.com/kivikakk/comrak/pull/630)
* `jetscii` is added for faster string searching, including SIMD on x86_64. (by @kivikakk in https://github.com/kivikakk/comrak/pull/630)
  * I'm [experimenting](https://github.com/kivikakk/comrak/pull/634) with aarch64 SIMD.

Documentation:

* The CLI help text has been copy-edited to a consistent style. (by @kivikakk in https://github.com/kivikakk/comrak/pull/641)
* The `README` example code is updated to build with recent API changes. (by @kivikakk in https://github.com/kivikakk/comrak/pull/621)

Build changes:

* `shortcodes` is enabled by default (but still optional) for CLI builds. (by @kivikakk in https://github.com/kivikakk/comrak/pull/641)
* `syntect` is now optional (but still default) in CLI builds. (by @kivikakk in https://github.com/kivikakk/comrak/pull/624)

Behind the scenes:

* Much of the block parser code has been re-organised, and many C-isms from the original port have been refactored into readable Rust. (by @kivikakk in https://github.com/kivikakk/comrak/pull/627)
* Likewise the inline parser has been re-organised. (by @kivikakk in https://github.com/kivikakk/comrak/pull/644)
* All `unsafe` blocks now have a `SAFETY` comment describing why their actions are safe.

# [v0.44.0] - 2025-10-14

Parser changes:

* Autolink validation is now stricter in the default mode, to maintain conformance with the GitHub Flavored Markdown autolinks extension spec. Those parses which previously worked but no longer do --- such as `http://localhost` (!), `www.com` (!?), or `https://` (!?!) --- are now part of the `relaxed_autolinks` option. See more discussion in the PR. (by @chamlis in https://github.com/kivikakk/comrak/pull/618)

# [v0.43.0] - 2025-09-29

Parser changes:

* `superscript` or `subscript` extensions only: punctuation following a superscript or subscript delimiter no longer disqualifies the delimiter from being considered left-flanking, such that `e^-i^` and `n~-i~` now parse as superscript or subscript respectively (by @kivikakk in https://github.com/kivikakk/comrak/pull/593)

Changed APIs:

* `html::format_document`, `xml::format_document`, `cm::format_document` and friends now take an `std::fmt::Write` as their `output` argument, instead of an `std::io::Write`, to avoid revalidating UTF-8 (by @kivikakk in https://github.com/kivikakk/comrak/pull/601)

# [v0.42.0] - 2025-09-24

New APIs:

* `cm::escape_inline` (aliased at crate level as `escape_commonmark_inline`)
  is added; escapes input text suitable for inclusion in a CommonMark
  document where regular inline processing takes place.  (by @kivikakk in
  https://github.com/kivikakk/comrak/pull/602)
* `cm::escape_link_destination` (aliased at crate level as
  `escape_commonmark_link_destination`) is added; escapes input URL suitable
  for use as a link destination in a CommonMark document.  (by @kivikakk in
  https://github.com/kivikakk/comrak/pull/605)

Changed APIs:

* `html::collect_text` now returns a `String`.  `html::collect_text_append` is
  added if you still want to start with your own (`String`) buffer.  (by
  @kivikakk in https://github.com/kivikakk/comrak/pull/600)
  * There was no particular reason for this populating a `Vec<u8>` instead of a
    `String`; it was just old.
* `Anchorizer::anchorizer` now takes `&str` instead of a `String`.  (by
  @kivikakk in https://github.com/kivikakk/comrak/pull/603)
  * As above.

# [v0.25.0] - 2024-07-12

* Discord-flavored Markdown by @Meow and @liamwhite in https://github.com/kivikakk/comrak/pull/421
  * Three new extensions and two render options are added:
    * `extension.underline` adds support for `__underlined__` text.
    * `extension.spoiler` adds support for `||spoiler||` text.
    * `extension.greentext` adds support for image board-style `>greentext`,
      which isn't transformed into a blockquote.
    * `render.ignore_setext` disables parsing setext-style headings.
    * `render.ignore_empty_links` causes links with no text (like `[](xyz)`) to
      remain in the text as-is.
* nodes: add From impls for AstNode. by @kivikakk in https://github.com/kivikakk/comrak/pull/424
  * Back by popular demand: `AstNode::from(NodeValue)`.
  * Also added is `AstNode::from(Ast)`, if you have sourcepos.
* AST validation by @yannham in https://github.com/kivikakk/comrak/pull/425
  * The AST is validated when formatting a document as CommonMark in debug builds.
* Address autolink edge cases. by @kivikakk in https://github.com/kivikakk/comrak/pull/426
  * Autolinks had many edge cases where output differed from upstream
    `cmark-gfm`. These have been fixed by following upstream's parser design
    closely.
* shortcodes: capture all known aliases. by @kivikakk in https://github.com/kivikakk/comrak/pull/427
  * We didn't parse shortcodes containing numbers or `+`. We do now.
* Support both upstream CommonMark and GFM's differences in the base spec. by @kivikakk in https://github.com/kivikakk/comrak/pull/428
  * GFM modifies even base CommonMark output somewhat. We now support and
    validate against both.
* cm: count ol items from start of each list. by @kivikakk in https://github.com/kivikakk/comrak/pull/429
  * Ordered list item numbers are normalised on formatting back to CommonMark.
* arena_tree: panic if iterator invalidation causes trouble. by @kivikakk in https://github.com/kivikakk/comrak/pull/437
  * `arena_tree` would silently stop iteration when trying to proceed from a
    child that had lost its parent. It now panics instead, as the old behaviour
    is incorrect and impossible to notice.
* broken reflink callback updates & big cleanup. by @kivikakk in https://github.com/kivikakk/comrak/pull/438
  * The broken reference link callback has been moved into `ParseOptions` (which
    now takes a lifetime, meaning `Options` does too).
  * The callback now takes a struct containing both the normalised reference,
    and the original text, and the return value has changed from a 2-tuple to a
    struct for clarity.
  * `parse_document_with_broken_link_callback` has been marked deprecated.
* Inline sourcepos fixes. by @kivikakk in https://github.com/kivikakk/comrak/pull/439
  * Inline sourcepos was provided on a best-effort basis, but there are multiple
    correctness issues which can't be fixed without significant work.
  * Inline sourcepos is no longer reported in HTML output. It remains in the AST
    and in XML output, but it is not reliable. See the PR for details.
  * Link sourcepos is slightly better than it was when it spans multiple lines.
